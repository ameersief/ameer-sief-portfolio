  **Design Movement**: Cinematic Minimalism
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Visual Silence**: Allow the photography to speak by minimizing UI elements and maximizing negative space.
  2. **Atmospheric Depth**: Use subtle parallax and depth of field effects in the UI to mirror the photographer's style.
  3. **Narrative Flow**: Structure the page as a story unfolding, rather than just sections stacked on top of each other.
  4. **Light & Shadow**: Mimic the "golden hour" aesthetic in the UI with warm glows against dark backgrounds.

  **Color Philosophy**: 
  A "Darkroom" aesthetic. Deep charcoal and midnight blue backgrounds (#0f0f1e) represent the unexposed film/darkroom, while warm amber/gold accents (#d4a574) represent the light that creates the image. This creates an emotional connection to the craft of photography itself.

  **Layout Paradigm**: 
  "Off-Grid Asymmetry". Avoid standard 12-column grids. Use overlapping elements where text partially overlays images, creating a magazine-editorial feel. Images should vary in aspect ratio and size to create rhythm.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Framing Brackets**: Animated corner brackets that appear on scroll to "frame" content, nodding to the camera viewfinder.
  2. **Light Leaks**: Subtle, CSS-based gradient overlays that mimic film light leaks on hover or section transitions.
  3. **Floating Captions**: Text that floats independently of images with different scroll speeds (parallax).

  **Interaction Philosophy**: 
  "Slow Reveal". Elements shouldn't just appear; they should develop like a photo in a darkroom. Smooth, slow fades and focus transitions. Hovering over images brings them into sharp focus while dimming surroundings.

  **Animation**:
  - **Scroll**: Smooth, inertia-based scrolling (using Lenis or similar feel).
  - **Transitions**: Cross-dissolve page transitions.
  - **Micro**: Magnetic buttons that pull towards the cursor.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Cormorant Garamond* (Italic & Regular mix) - Elegant, high-contrast serif that feels like a fashion magazine.
  - **Body**: *Manrope* - Clean, modern geometric sans-serif for perfect legibility at small sizes.
  - **Hierarchy**: Massive, thin display text for section headers contrasting with small, tracked-out uppercase labels.

  **Design Movement**: Brutalist Luxury
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw Structure**: Expose the grid lines and structure, treating the website as an architectural blueprint.
  2. **Bold Contrast**: High contrast between large typography and fine photography details.
  3. **Unapologetic Scale**: Oversized elements that demand attention.
  4. **Materiality**: Textures that feel tactile, like high-quality photo paper.

  **Color Philosophy**: 
  Monochromatic Monochrome. Stark black (#000000) and paper white (#F0F0F0) with a single electric blue (#0044FF) accent for interaction points. This strips away distraction, focusing purely on composition and form, much like black and white photography.

  **Layout Paradigm**: 
  "Modular Masonry". A rigid but complex grid where images lock into place like puzzle pieces. Text is often vertical or rotated 90 degrees to break the horizontal flow.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Visible Grid Lines**: Thin, 1px lines separating content areas.
  2. **Monospace Data**: Meta-data (ISO, Aperture, Date) displayed in a technical monospace font next to images.
  3. **Hover Inversion**: interacting with elements inverts their colors completely.

  **Interaction Philosophy**: 
  "Snap & Precision". Interactions are instant and sharp, no soft fades. Cursors change based on content (e.g., "VIEW" circle cursor over images).

  **Animation**:
  - **Scroll**: Snap-to-section scrolling.
  - **Transitions**: Slide and wipe effects.
  - **Micro**: Glitch effects on hover for a digital/modern edge.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Archivo Black* - Heavy, industrial sans-serif.
  - **Body**: *Space Mono* - Technical, typewriter-style font for details.
  - **Hierarchy**: Headlines are massive (10vw), body text is small and precise.

  **Design Movement**: Ethereal Gallery
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Floating Space**: Elements should feel weightless, suspended in a void.
  2. **Soft Focus**: Extensive use of blur and glassmorphism to create depth.
  3. **Fluidity**: Everything is in constant, gentle motion.
  4. **Immersive Canvas**: The entire screen is the canvas; no containers or boxes.

  **Color Philosophy**: 
  "Golden Hour Haze". Soft gradients of peach, lavender, and warm grey (#fdfbf7 background). Text is dark grey, never black. This mimics the soft, diffused light of sunset photography.

  **Layout Paradigm**: 
  "Organic Scatter". Images are placed seemingly randomly (but carefully calculated) across the canvas. Text wraps around images organically. No hard lines or boxes.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1. **Glass Overlays**: Frosted glass panels for text over images.
  2. **Cursor Spotlight**: The cursor acts as a light source, slightly illuminating the area around it.
  3. **Fluid Shapes**: Background blobs that morph slowly.

  **Interaction Philosophy**: 
  "Liquid Response". Elements ripple or distort slightly like water when interacted with.

  **Animation**:
  - **Scroll**: Horizontal scrolling for galleries.
  - **Transitions**: Morphing shapes.
  - **Micro**: Images scale up and float upwards gently on hover.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: *Playfair Display* - Classic, high-contrast serif.
  - **Body**: *Lato* - Humanist sans-serif that feels friendly and warm.
  - **Hierarchy**: Soft, elegant, and understated.
